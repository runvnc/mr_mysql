# Test Questions for Event Management System

# Basic Queries
1. "[Current date: June 1, 2024] How many events are scheduled for next month?"
   (Tests basic date filtering and counting - should find July events)

2. "[Current date: June 1, 2024] List all sessions in the upcoming AI Summit"
   (Tests simple joins and filtering)

3. "What's the total capacity for all rooms?"
   (Tests basic aggregation)

# Moderate Complexity
4. "[Current date: June 1, 2024] Which sessions in the AI Summit (June 15-17) still have available spots?"
   (Tests capacity calculations and multiple joins)

5. "[Current date: June 1, 2024] Who is our most popular speaker based on registration numbers so far?"
   (Tests complex joins and aggregations)

6. "[Current date: June 1, 2024] Show me all sessions that are currently waitlisted"
   (Tests status handling and multiple conditions)

# Complex/Error-Prone Queries
7. "[Current date: June 1, 2024] Find attendees registered for overlapping sessions during the upcoming AI Summit"
   (Tests temporal logic and self-joins)

8. "[Current date: June 1, 2024] What's the average attendance for our events so far?"
   (Intentionally ambiguous - per session? per event? Tests error handling)

9. "[Current date: June 1, 2024] Show me similar sessions to the Machine Learning Workshop at the AI Summit"
   (Tests handling of undefined similarity criteria)

10. "[Current date: June 1, 2024] Which rooms are usually empty during conference hours (9 AM - 5 PM) at the AI Summit?"
    (Tests temporal ambiguity and definition of 'empty')

Note: These questions test various aspects of the system:
- Basic SQL generation
- Date/time handling
- Capacity calculations
- Ambiguity resolution
- Error handling
- Complex joins and aggregations
